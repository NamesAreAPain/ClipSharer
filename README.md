Posts pictures from your clipboard to Discord

To use, simply clone/download the repository, and add two files:

1. "token.txt", which should contain a discord bot access token, configured with permission to send messages and attach files. For more information see [this article](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/discord.html#discord-intro)
2. "channel.txt", which should contain the number part of the channel id you want to post to.
